# NOTES

## Description
I have used React for making this application, axios for getting data from back-end, moment for working with dates.

  `npm install`
  `npm run dev`

## Improvements
Possible improvements
- add some styles preprocessor (sass/less)
- move some logig from App component to utils, for example sorting
- make better error handling and processing
- make design improvements, for example style checkboxes, sorting arrows, article views
